x What is SSH?

SSH, which stands for Secure SHell, is a way (protocol) to insure a secure connection between two computers. 
Secure means that all communication between those computers is encrypted, and this includes the process of 
logging in. 

x How to set up an SSH connection?

First we need to generate an SSH key. An SSH key is a means for a computer to identify itself to an SSH server. 

This is what I did upon installing debian in my virtual machine (see my commit: Debian for Virtualbox)

- go to the terminal of your virtual machine which already has debian installed
- type: ssh-keygen -t rsa
This generates the key. "-t" stands for type, and "rsa" stands for the encryption method
- Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): Leave blank and press enter
- Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Leave blank and press enter
- Enter again: Leave blank and press enter
- Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
- Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
- Then write down where your public key has been saved: /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

The file which has been created is a ".pub file". This file is or contains the certificate that is gonna 
enable us to login to another computer without having to use a password.

After completing this step I went to the terminal on my linux computer. 
My first step was checking whether or not I could ping my virtual machine:

- type: ping <ipaddress of virtual machine>

This was a succes, so now I tried to get into the virtual machine with an ssh connection

- type: ssh <virtual machine user name>@<ipaddress of virtual machine>

This was also a succes. Now i was logged into my virtual machine with my own computer.

I logged back into my own computer again.

- type: ctrl-d

X How can we use ansible?

First we need to make a directory where our host(s) (in my case the virtual machine) is/are defined.

- type: sudo mkdir /etc/ansible

Now we need to make a file in this directory with the ip adress(es) of the host(s)

- type: sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

All we need to do here is write down the ip adress(es)

- type: <ipaddress of virtual machine>
- ctrl-x
- Yes
- ctrl-x

I thought I had all steps completed so I tried to ping my virtual machine with ansible

- type: ansible all -m ping -u <virtual machine user name>
or
- type: ansible all -m ping

To my amazement my virtual machine was still unreachable. So i had to generate the SSH key here as well.

- type: ssh-keygen -t rsa
This generates the key. "-t" stands for type, and "rsa" stands for the encryption method
- Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): Leave blank and press enter
- Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Leave blank and press enter
- Enter again: Leave blank and press enter
- Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
- Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
- Then write down where your public key has been saved: /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Now the key needs to be copied into the appropriate directory

- type (in one line): cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh ron@192.168.178.16 'umask 0077; mkdir -p .ssh;
 cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys && echo "Key copied"'
or
- type: ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@vm

Again I tried to SSH into my virtual machine again

- type: ssh <virtual machine user name>@<ipaddress of virtual machine>

This worked so i logged back into my laptop

- ctrl-d

Since everything should work now I tried to ping my virtual machine / remote host with anisible once again

- type: ansible all -m ping

I received my very first PING PONG, so ansible was and is ready to dive into!
