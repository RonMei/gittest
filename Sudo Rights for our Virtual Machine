In order to be able to manage our virtual machine through ansible ad hoc commands and playbooks,
we need to give sudo rights to our virtual machine.

From the terminal of our own computer (the local machine) we need to log into the virtual machine
(the remote machine).
- type: ssh <virtual machine user name>@<ipaddress of virtual machine>

Now we need to become root on our remote machine.
- type: su -

Now we need to install sudo.
- type: apt-get install sudo

Now we need to define which user will be given the sudo rights.
- type: adduser <username> sudo

To effect these changes we need to log out from the remote machine and log back in.
After logging back in we want to test whether or not we have been given the sudo rights.
- type: sudo apt-get update

If the update runs, and it will, we know that we will be able to run playbooks from our local
machine to manage our remote machine.
